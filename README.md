# Jacob Redmon's personal website.
This is my personal website to host my projects and resume on.

### Homepage Random Quote
On page load, a random quote taken from my Kindle notes from books I have read will appear.

### Bingo Board
My first project is an interactive Bingo Board. 
To use it, simply click on the number that was drawn and it will turn red. 
Hitting the "Reset" button on the bottom returns the board to its original state.
Additionally, clicking the "Pull a number" button will mimic randomly drawing a bingo ball.
